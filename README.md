Chronos' Clock is an implementation of [SlowMo Lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/slowmo-lib), primarily meant for singleplayer use.
It adds a craftable, adjustable clock that can modify your game speed at will... at a price!

### SlowMo is still in its Alpha stage. There *will* be a bunch of graphical glitches and mod incompatibilities. Be sure to report them at [this mod github page](https://github.com/TheMegax/SlowMo-Lib/issues).

### Needs [Cloth Caonfig](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) to be able to use the in-game config screen.
